## Summary


College is the place to explore and share. It’s the time to find a new hobby, join a community of friends, and check off things from your bucket list. Despite this, the two of us struggled to find these opportunities at our college and discover a community of people. That’s when the idea of Spur (short for sporadic) sparked – a product that could **foster learning, discovery, and growth by facilitating convenient connections** between those seeking to explore and those hoping to teach what they love.


The development of Spur was a 5 stage approach: (1) Ideation, (2) User Research, (3) Competitive Analysis), (4) Wireframing, (5) Building an MVP.
